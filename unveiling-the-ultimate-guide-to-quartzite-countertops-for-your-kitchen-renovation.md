## **What Is Quartzite? An Introduction to This Natural Stone**

### **The Composition and Formation of Quartzite**

Quartzite is a natural metamorphic rock formed deep within the Earth’s crust
when sandstone undergoes intense heat and pressure. This process rewires
silica grains inside the sandstone, transforming them into a dense, hard, and
durable material. Unlike quartz, which is engineered, quartzite is entirely
natural—a key factor in its appeal.

### **Distinguishing Quartzite from Quartz and Other Stones**

Many confuse quartzite with quartz. While their names are similar, their
origins diverge significantly; quartz is engineered, whereas quartzite is
natural. Recognizing these differences can influence your decision-making
process when selecting countertops.
