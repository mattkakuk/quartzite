## **What Is Quartzite? A Natural Wonder**

### **Defining Quartzite: Nature’s Masterpiece**

Quartzite is a natural metamorphic rock that originates from sandstone. Under
intense pressure and heat over thousands of years, sandstone transforms into a
dense, durable, and visually striking material. Unlike quartz, which is
engineered, quartzite is a purely natural product, prized for its beauty and
resilience.

### **The Composition of Quartzite**

This stone mainly consists of quartz grains—sometimes over 90%—giving it
exceptional hardness and crystalline beauty. Its mineral-rich composition
results in a unique, speckled appearance that resembles marble but with added
durability.
