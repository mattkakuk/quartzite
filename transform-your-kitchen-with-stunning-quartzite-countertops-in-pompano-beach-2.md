## **What Is Quartzite? An Introduction to This Natural Wonder**

### **The Beauty and Strength of Quartzite**

Quartzite is a stunning, highly durable natural stone quarried from the earth,
known for its veining and rich color variations. Unlike quartz, which is
engineered, quartzite forms naturally through the metamorphic process of
sandstone, transforming into an incredibly resilient surface.

### **Why Choose Quartzite Over Other Materials?**

Many homeowners ask us whether quartzite surpasses granite or marble in
durability. The answer? Absolutely. Its hardness rivals that of quartz and
granite, making it an excellent choice for kitchens that see daily use.
