## **What Is Quartzite? An Introduction to Natural Stone**

### **The Natural Origins of Quartzite**

Quartzite is a natural metamorphic stone formed from sandstone subjected to
intense heat and pressure over millions of years. This process transforms the
sandstone into a dense, durable material rich in quartz content, giving it
remarkable strength and natural elegance. Unlike quartz countertops, which are
engineered, quartzite is _completely natural_ , making it a popular choice for
homeowners seeking authenticity in their kitchen surfaces.

### **Comparing Quartzite and Quartz Countertops**

While both quartzite and quartz may sound similar, they differ significantly.
Quartz is engineered—composed of crushed quartz, resins, and pigments—offering
more uniformity and color options. In contrast, quartzite features unique
veining and coloration, much like marble but with greater hardness, making it
less prone to scratching or staining.
